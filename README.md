# scorespad 🃏
Your board game scoring paperless, no need of spare sheets 🔖.

- It is 100% serverless, it uses client storage to save games and scores.
- Each device has a set of games, you can share among devices using the scan tool.
- It is entirely open, so you can use it for any case you want (dominos, cards, custom games, uno, you name it).
- It is (at least I tried) offered in 3 languages.
- Customize your skin, if you get bored of the default skin.

### Usage

- On the Games screen, create new games, or rename those already in list.
- On the game screen, setup team or player names and add more players to the game.
- On the scores scren, see and increment each game's score.
- Once a game is finalized, you can see the stats on the game screen.

### For Developers

- `npm i && npm start`
- Enjoy
